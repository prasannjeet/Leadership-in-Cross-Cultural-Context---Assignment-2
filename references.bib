  abstract={The paper explores the ethical issues which multinational companies are fronting when doing business abroad. In a business that competes mainly in global markets, multinational companies (MNCs) operate in different social, cultural and ethical environments. This poses significant ethical dilemmas over MNCs. Particularly, choosing how to behave, is not a choice between good and bad, right and wrong, but only between the right and right choice. The first section elaborates on ethical dimensions of MNC's business and issues such as child labor, sweatshops, discrimination, environment pollution, indigenous people rights, nepotism, human rights, bribery and corruption. Questions whether MNCs have obligation or not towards suppliers, subcontractors and consumers are represented. The second section presents the ethical behavior options for companies in global business regarding ethical relativism, ethical imperialism, ethical reciprocity and universal ethics.},
